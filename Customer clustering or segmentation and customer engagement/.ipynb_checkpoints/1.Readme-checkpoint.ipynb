    "## Objective of the Project\n",
    "- The objective of the project is to employ unsupervised learning algorithms on a dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "- The aim will be to identify cluster patterns from the dataset, to help the fashion and cosmetic companies in increasing impressions (maximize the visibility of the posts and reach to a wider audience) and hence increase customer engagement on their  facebook page.\n",
    "- To explore the variations in engagements on hourly and yearly basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminologies\n",
    "1. ### Customer Segmentation or Clustering\n",
    "Segmentation, involves dividing a large customer base into specific groups or segments based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. ### Customer Engagement\n",
    "Customer engagement refers to the level of interaction and involvement that a customer has with a brand or company.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/488/facebook+live+sellers+in+thailand)\n",
    "- The dataset contains data from facebook pages of 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers, selling their products online through facebook. \n",
    "- The posts on their pages are of a different nature such as video, photos, statuses, and links. \n",
    "- User interaction is quantified using various engagement metrics such as comments, shares, and reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "1. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "    - Situation\n",
    "    - Behaviour\n",
    "    - Impact\n",
    "2. Observe the variations in engagements on yearly basis\n",
    "    - Situation\n",
    "    - Behaviour\n",
    "    - Impact\n",
    "        - Before 2015\n",
    "            - We observed that before 2015 the features like num_loves,num_wows,num_hahas,num_sads and num_angrys were not                     available.\n",
    "            - Num lkes and num reactions were always more than num shares and num comments.\n",
    "            - If we see as a whole, from 2012 to 2015 the user interactions have shown an increase for each type of engagement                 that were available. \n",
    "            - If we see for each kind of post then following can be concluded:\n",
    "                - Users interacted highy with video contents before 2014, but during 2014-2015, the user interactions with video\n",
    "                  content seems to decline for some reasons.\n",
    "                - Vice versa happened with photo type content, during 2014-2015 the user interactions with photo type contents                     increased steeply. \n",
    "                - User interactions with links and status type content showed similiar behaviour as of photo content.\n",
    "        - After 2015\n",
    "            - If we see as a whole, from 2016 to 2018 the user interactions have shown an increase for each type of engagement.                that were available. \n",
    "            - From 2016 to 2018 users interacted more by using the comments compared to other available features.\n",
    "            - If we see for each kind of post then following can be concluded:\n",
    "                - The users interacted with video content using comments feature.\n",
    "                - The users interacted with photo content using reactions and likes features. The users interactions using                         comments declined in year 2017-2018.\n",
    "                - The users highly interacted with status type content using likes and reactions feature.\n",
    "                - For link type content the users interactions using likes and reactions declined in year 2017-2018.\n",
    "                \n",
    "3. Observe the variations in engagements on hourly basis\n",
    "    - Situation\n",
    "    - Behaviour\n",
    "    - Impact\n",
    "4. Employ PCA for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "    - Situation\n",
    "    - Behaviour\n",
    "    - Impact\n",
    "         - For before 2015 dataset, the optimal principal components achieved were two. These two principal components if used              will carry 95% of the original information.\n",
    "         - For after 2015 dataset, the optimal principal components achieved were seven. These seven principal components if                used will carry 95% of the original information.\n",
    "5. Employ K-Means for observing clusters\n",
    "    - Situation\n",
    "    - Behaviour\n",
    "    - Impact\n",
    "        - Using K-Means without using dimensionality reduction technique prior resulted in poor clustering.\n",
    "6. Employ combined PCA and K-Means \n",
    "    - Situation\n",
    "    - Behaviour\n",
    "    - Impact\n",
    "        - Using dimensionality reduction prior to K-Means helped in seeing visible clustering.\n",
    "        - For both datasets after 2015 and before 2015, the optimal number of clusters came out to be 3."
